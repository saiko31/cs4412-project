# Pattern discovery of injury risk factors in under-25 proffesional footballers

## Overview

Author: Alexander San Agustin Melendez

This project seeks to apply data mining techniques to find relationships between various factors (age, position, minutes played, etc.) and how these factors affect injuries in soccer players under the age of 25.

For this project, StatsBomb Open Data Repository is used: https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data/tree/master.
Scraped data from Transfermarkt is also used.
